# dcos-vagrant for Portworx
[Portworx](https://docs.portworx.com) highly availabile persistent data fabric for containers requires agents to 
provide additional local storage, to create the global storage pool.

This `portworx` examples directory allows test driving Portworx within a vagrant/vbox environment.

Please use these config files to startup a `portworx-ready` dcos-vagrant cluster.

Portworx can then be installed by following the DCOS installation docs at [docs.portworx.com](https://docs.portworx.com)
